# Computer-Science-Tutorial-Dialogues-Dataset

The dataset contains 54 transcribed one-on-one tutoring sessions on computer science introductory data structures (transcripts table). The data structures in question are linked lists, stacks and binary search trees. The transcripts are annotated for the following tutoring moves / strategies (annotations table):

- Positive Feedback (+FB)
- Negative Feedback (-FB)
- Direct Procedural Instruction (DPI)
- Direct Declarative Instruction (DDI)
- Student Initiative (SI)
- Prompt (PT)
- Worked Out Example (WOE)
- Analogy

The first 6 tags (+FB, -FB, DPI, DDI, SI, PT) are turn level annotations; the last two (WOE and Analogy) are multiturn annotations, that are marked in the transcripts with Begin and End markers on the turns that begin and end the strategy, respectively.

Because of human protection requirements, we are unable to release audio and video (the video was limited to the hands of the student and the tutor, and the papers they had in front of them)
